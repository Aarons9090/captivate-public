# Captivate
A tool to make social media posts that standout

This site is very work in progress but my plan is to fully complete and release this.

The idea was to create an easy tool to make captivating social media posts that don't drown out in the pool of other people. Broadcasting your opinnions with large visual posts catch more attention and you can better build you brands visual style.
